--- abstract

This specification defines how an identity provider binds a
platform-authenticated agent to a registered agent principal and
issues authorization grants for that principal. It profiles
platform-issued JWT subject evidence in token exchange,
Attestation-Based Client Authentication, and SPIFFE X.509-SVID and
WIT-SVID client authentication, together with the client credentials
grant when an intermediate token is needed, and OAuth 2.0 Token
Exchange. Stable instance identification is
an optional extension. The resulting Workload Authorization Grant
identifies a self-acting agent as subject; an Identity Assertion JWT
Authorization Grant identifies an agent acting for a user through the
OAuth Actor Profile.

# Introduction

An agent's identity in OAuth has three independent dimensions. The
agent principal is the non-human identity an identity provider (IdP)
governs, with status, owner, and assignments. The acting relationship
is whether the agent acts for itself or on behalf of a user. The
instance is the installation or execution presenting a request.
Conflating these dimensions causes most agent authorization errors: a
client identifier is treated as a principal, an execution is treated
as an agent, or a self-acting agent is given a user's delegation.

This document specifies both acting relationships end to end. An
agent acting for itself obtains a Workload Authorization Grant
{{WAG}} naming the agent as subject. An agent acting on behalf of a
user obtains an Identity Assertion JWT Authorization Grant {{ID-JAG}}
naming the user as subject and the agent as actor under
{{ACTOR-PROFILE}}. Both grants are issued by the IdP, bound to a key
the agent proves, and redeemed at a Resource Authorization Server
(RAS) for a sender-constrained access token.

The agent presents evidence its platform can produce: a platform-issued
JWT, a Client Attestation, or a SPIFFE SVID. The IdP binds the validated
external identity to a Registered Agent in its own namespace. Platform
JWTs supply workload evidence for token exchange without requiring the
agent to be an OAuth client. ATTEST and SPIFFE client authentication
also establish an OAuth client identity; a shared ATTEST client uses
`agent_id` to distinguish its agents. Optional instance context
identifies the installation or execution presenting the request.

For self-acting access, the preferred path exchanges the platform
JWT, Client Attestation, or WIT-SVID directly for WAG. The credential
is the `subject_token` under {{RFC8693}}; the IdP validates it and
its required proofs, resolves the Registered Agent, and checks
assignments before issuing the grant. No intermediate access token
is required for these inputs.

X.509-SVID authenticates a TLS connection but supplies no JWT to
exchange. That input uses a short-lived IdP access token as an
adapter. An IdP access token is also used for explicit user delegation:
the IdP access token supplies Actor Profile with the canonical agent
identity as `actor_token`, alongside the user's credential. Platform
JWT acquisition uses token exchange with separate client authentication;
ATTEST and SPIFFE acquisition use client credentials. The token MAY
also be used for WAG when already available. {{paths}} summarizes
these paths; {{bootstrap}} defines acquisition when needed.

The normative scope is agent evidence, identity resolution,
access-token acquisition, grant issuance, and the redemption
requirements both grants share. ID-JAG's format and downstream
processing come from {{ID-JAG}} and {{ACTOR-PROFILE}}. WAG defines
the grant concept and its RFC 7523 redemption; this document defines
the token type, JWT type, issuer model, audience, key binding, and
claims needed to issue a WAG from an IdP ({{self-exchange}},
{{grant}}). This document does not define another downstream grant
profile.

Existing client-based delegation, including MCP Enterprise-Managed
Authorization, does not require this flow. Model selection is described in
{{models}} and compatibility guidance in {{deployment}}.
End-to-end deployment examples appear in {{flows}}.

The proposed replacement for draft-mcguinness-oauth-ai-agent-instance
is the pair draft-mcguinness-oauth-workload-agent-federation and
draft-mcguinness-oauth-client-instance-identification. The former
specifies governed agent identity and grant issuance; the latter
specifies optional instance identification using ATTEST.
draft-mcguinness-oauth-client-instance-assertion remains a separate
proposal for a standalone assertion alongside other client
authentication methods. These individual drafts do not require
adoption of one another except where explicitly profiled.

## Relationship to Client Attestation and Actor Profile

A platform-issued JWT supplies subject evidence for imported workload
identities. {{ATTEST}} supplies client authentication for attested
instances; {{SPIFFE-OAUTH}} supplies native X.509-SVID and WIT-SVID
client authentication. WIT-SVID uses a Workload Identity Token {{WIT}}
directly in the ATTEST header with its key-possession proof; no
additional attestation wraps the WIT. All inputs resolve to an IdP
agent principal and establish a DPoP key. {{INSTANCE}} optionally adds
stable instance context to ATTEST. The ATTEST binding retains
`sub=client_id` and adds `agent_id` only for shared clients.

A platform JWT is presented only as `subject_token`, not as a client
authentication assertion. Direct WAG exchange can omit separate client
authentication under {{platform-client}}. ATTEST and WIT-SVID can
supply both authentication and subject evidence in one request.
Successful validation alone does not authorize the requested access.
When needed, an IdP access token carries the resolved agent into
exchange. WAG and ID-JAG authorize issuance at the downstream RAS.

For delegation, Actor Profile supplies actor construction and
preservation rules. The registered agent is the actor; the instance
is execution context. Self-acting access and instance identification
alone do not require Actor Profile. Downstream servers trust the
IdP's grant and need not validate the platform's attestation.

## Choosing an Identity Model {#models}

This section is informative.

Choose the model according to the principal the IdP governs and
the identity the platform can authenticate:

| Model | Use when | Identity and token path | Reason and cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| Existing client-based delegation | The OAuth client is sufficient for policy and no separate registered agent identity is needed | Existing ID-JAG/EMA flow; client context is implicit, or Actor Profile represents the client explicitly | Preserves current deployments without an additional bootstrap; a shared client does not distinguish its agents |
| Imported workload principal | The platform supplies workload identity and the IdP governs the imported agent independently of an OAuth client | Platform JWT subject evidence maps to Registered Agent; direct WAG needs no client registration; ID-JAG uses a separately authenticated client | Preserves external namespaces and supports shared platform subjects with exact agent claims |
| Agent with its own client identity | The IdP governs a Registered Agent and that agent can authenticate as its own OAuth client | ATTEST or SPIFFE authenticates `client_id`; map to Registered Agent, using direct JWT exchange for WAG or an IdP token when needed | Simplest federation binding; requires managing a client identity for each independently identified agent |
| Agents behind a shared client | The IdP governs agents individually but the platform authenticates through a common OAuth client | ATTEST `sub=client_id` plus `agent_id`; map to Registered Agent and exchange the attestation directly for WAG, or obtain an actor token for ID-JAG | Avoids separate client identities for hosted agents; requires trusting the attester to distinguish agents and authorize their runtimes |

Use the existing client-based path when its identity and policy
semantics are sufficient. When a Registered Agent identity is needed,
use workload federation for imported platform identities, or the agent's
own client identity when ATTEST or SPIFFE already establishes it.
Use `agent_id` to distinguish agents behind a shared client, rather than duplicating
an identity already supplied by `client_id`. These choices do not
depend on whether the implementation is an MCP client or uses CIMD.

A client identifier metadata document {{CIMD}} can give every hosted
agent its own `client_id` without registration, which appears to
remove the need for a shared client. It does not remove the need for
an authority that vouches for which agent is running. A CIMD client
identifier is asserted by whoever controls its URL; the IdP still
needs an approved attester or SVID issuer to bind it to a Registered
Agent. The shared-client model places that authority where it already
exists, in the platform's registered client and its attester, and
uses `agent_id` to name the agent the attester verified. The cost is
that the attester's authority spans every agent behind the client;
{{security}} states the resulting requirements.

The acting relationship is a separate choice. In each federation
model, self-acting access produces WAG with the Registered Agent as
`sub`; user-delegated access produces ID-JAG with the user as `sub`
and the Registered Agent as `act`. An agent can therefore be both
an OAuth client and a delegated actor. Mapping its client identity
to an IdP principal does not create another actor hop.

Instance identity is another dimension: one agent can run in several
installations or executions. `client_instance_id` distinguishes the
configured unit for audit and risk; it does not choose the agent
principal or acting relationship.
Instance identification is optional in this federation flow and in
existing client-based flows. Key possession remains required here
whether or not a stable instance identifier is available.

# Conventions and Scope

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

OAuth terms follow {{RFC6749}} and {{RFC8693}}. Client Attestation,
Client Attester, and Client Instance follow {{ATTEST}}. Instance
Identifier and Instance Context follow {{INSTANCE}}.

Registered Agent:
: A non-human principal represented at the IdP with a stable,
  non-reassignable identifier, status, and authorized platform bindings.

Federation Binding:
: An approved association between a credential authority, external
  identity, tenant, and Registered Agent, plus OAuth client context
  where required. A platform JWT binding records exact claim selectors
  and permitted clients when client authentication is used. An ATTEST
  binding includes the platform agent identifier for a shared client.

Source Tenant:
: The IdP tenant that governs the Registered Agent and issues the
  access token and grant.

Target Tenant:
: The tenant at the RAS in which the agent or user is authorized,
  identified by the IdP's configuration for the approved RAS and
  resource.

Agent Status:
: The IdP's current lifecycle state for a Registered Agent, at
  minimum active or disabled. Only an active agent is eligible for
  issuance.

A client or IdP claiming this profile MUST implement at least one
input binding in {{inputs}} and the exchange requirements for its
role and supported outputs. WAG implementations using a JWT input
MUST support direct exchange under {{direct-wag}}. Acquisition under
{{bootstrap}} is REQUIRED for X.509-SVID and delegated implementations
and OPTIONAL for implementations supporting only direct WAG exchange.
Where acquisition is supported, the corresponding IdP access-token
input MUST be supported for each implemented output. The parties MUST
establish a common input and supported outputs through trusted
configuration and existing metadata. The delegated output additionally
requires {{ACTOR-PROFILE}}. WAG defines the grant
concept; {{wag-profile}} defines its issuance by an IdP. Until {{WAG}}
adopts or references those definitions they are specific to this
document, and {{coordination}} lists the open items. Task authority,
delegation chains, and input bindings not listed in {{inputs}} are
outside this profile.

# Profile Selection and Identity Binding {#identity}

The IdP MUST configure the input binding, credential
verification authorities and keys, identity model, tenant, and
permitted outputs. Configuration MUST also identify approved RAS
issuers, resources, target tenants, and subject and client mappings.
An unsigned request hint or discovered client metadata MUST NOT
establish this authority or switch the configured input binding.
Bindings MAY be established by importing agents from a platform's
registry. An import is configuration: it MUST be authenticated and
audited like any other binding change, and it MUST record the platform
issuer and the exact claim names and values it binds.

| Input and identity model | Federation Binding lookup |
|---|---|
| Platform-issued JWT, imported workload | Approved issuer and configured exact identity claims under {{platform-jwt-input}}; OAuth client identity is separate |
| ATTEST, agent is the client | Exact attestation `(iss, sub)`; no `agent_id` |
| ATTEST, shared client | Exact attestation `(iss, sub, agent_id)` |
| SPIFFE X.509-SVID, agent is the client | Approved trust domain and exact SPIFFE ID; `client_id` equals that ID |
| SPIFFE WIT-SVID, agent is the client | Approved trust domain and exact WIT `sub`; `client_id` equals that SPIFFE ID |

The IdP MUST resolve this lookup to one Registered Agent. Missing,
ambiguous, or disabled bindings MUST cause rejection. In ATTEST,
it MUST reject `agent_id` for an agent's own client and require it
for a shared client. Claim presence MUST NOT select the model.
Multiple approved bindings MAY identify one Registered Agent;
display names or unqualified strings MUST NOT establish equivalence.
The Registered Agent identifier need not equal the external identifier.

The Registered Agent identifier MUST be unique and non-reassignable
within the IdP issuer's namespace. Source and target tenants MUST
be unambiguous. A new installation, execution, or key does not by
itself create a new Registered Agent. A required binding MUST NOT
be bypassed by omitting evidence or falling back to shared-client
credentials. Other client flows retain their own requirements.

Each item of evidence establishes one thing. Client authentication
establishes the client; the Federation Binding establishes the agent;
the DPoP proof establishes the key; an audience value or
caller-supplied claim establishes nothing by itself. The IdP MUST
require every element its configuration demands and MUST NOT infer
one from another.

## Evidence and Client Authentication {#inputs}

Every acquisition and exchange request MUST include a fresh DPoP
proof under {{RFC9449}}. Implementations MUST support `ES256` for
DPoP. The IdP MUST bind the resolved agent, source tenant, and proven
key, plus the authenticated logical client when required, to the same
request. Platform JWTs supply subject evidence; the other inputs also
authenticate the client. Subsequent use of an IdP access token follows
{{idp-processing}}.

* When issuing an intermediate access token, the IdP MUST record
  its input method and external binding and check their current
  validity when that token is exchanged under {{idp-processing}}.
* The request MUST NOT supply a separate `agent_id` parameter; its
  presence MUST cause `invalid_request`. Within credentials, `agent_id` is permitted only for shared-client ATTEST
  or as an explicitly configured platform JWT identity claim. Other
  uses MUST be rejected with `invalid_client_attestation` for ATTEST
  and `invalid_grant` for other subject evidence.
* No input alone establishes stable instance context. The IdP MUST
  NOT infer `client_instance` from a workload identifier, key, or
  certificate, or copy unvalidated claims. Validated claims under
  {{instance-identification}} are the only source of that context.
* A JWT input credential MAY be the `subject_token` for direct WAG
  exchange under {{direct-wag}}. Input credentials MUST NOT be used
  as `actor_token`; delegated exchange uses an IdP-issued access token.
* Renewal or reissuance of an input credential does not rebind an
  existing access token to a different DPoP key. A changed key
  requires new issuance.

### Platform-Issued JWT {#platform-jwt-input}

The client MUST present a JWT issued by an approved platform as
`subject_token`, with
`subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`, in a token
exchange request. This input is workload evidence, not client
authentication under {{RFC7523}}. It MUST NOT be presented as
`client_assertion`. The requested output is WAG under {{direct-wag}}
or an IdP access token under {{platform-acquisition}}.

The Federation Binding MUST specify `sub` and MAY additionally specify
one or more exact, top-level string claims identifying the agent or
restricting its identity context. Each specified claim MUST be present,
be a nonempty string, and exactly match its configured value. For
example, a shared platform `sub` can be qualified by a platform agent
identifier and tenant claim. All selectors MUST match; missing claims,
patterns, prefixes, and ambiguous matches MUST NOT establish a binding.
Claim selection comes from trusted configuration, not request parameters.
The issuer-qualified combination MUST resolve to one Registered Agent.
No external claim is required to equal an OAuth `client_id`.

Client authentication, when required, follows {{platform-client}}.
A Federation Binding MAY designate an IdP-assigned OAuth client or an
explicit set of permitted clients, independently of the platform's
identity namespace. That association authorizes use of the binding
by those clients; it MUST NOT substitute for client authentication.

For each approved platform issuer the IdP MUST configure the exact
issuer identifier; the key source, which MUST be issuer metadata
under {{OIDC}} or {{RFC8414}} or a configured key set and MUST NOT
be a URL or key supplied in the JWT; audience values, which MUST
identify the IdP; permitted asymmetric algorithms; maximum age and
lifetime; and allowable clock skew.

The configured maximum age MUST NOT exceed 300 seconds; clock skew
MUST NOT exceed 30 seconds. The IdP MUST distinguish these credentials
from other JWTs issued by the platform: it MUST require either an
explicit, configured protected-header `typ` used only for this
workload-identity credential class, or a dedicated issuer used only for that class.
A generic `typ=JWT` does not supply this distinction. The IdP MUST
reject credentials outside the configured class, including tokens
intended as user ID Tokens or API access tokens.

The IdP MUST validate the JWT under {{RFC7519}} and {{RFC8725}},
including the signature, exact configured `iss`, intended `aud`, and
expiration. The claims `iss` and `sub` MUST be nonempty strings. This
input requires `iat` and `exp` as NumericDates, with `iat` preceding `exp`.
The IdP MUST reject missing or incorrectly typed timestamps, an `iat`
in the future beyond configured clock skew, or a JWT outside its
configured age or lifetime limits. A JWT carrying `act` MUST be
rejected; this input establishes the agent itself, not a delegation
chain. The validated claims MUST satisfy the configured binding above.

A platform-issued JWT is a bearer credential with no key of its
own. A separate DPoP proof establishes the token-binding key, which
the platform need not know. Both MUST be validated in the same request.
For this input the IdP MUST require a server-provided DPoP nonce under
{{RFC9449, Section 8}} on every acquisition and exchange request.
A missing or invalid nonce MUST produce `use_dpop_nonce` with a fresh
nonce; the client retries with a new proof. This prevents proof
pre-generation but does not prevent theft of the bearer JWT before
its first use.

To support platforms that cache credentials, the same JWT MAY be
reused with fresh DPoP proofs. On its first successful use, the IdP
MUST atomically associate the SHA-256 digest of the JWS Signing Input
{{RFC7515}} with the Federation Binding and proven DPoP key. It MUST retain this
association until the JWT expires, including allowable clock skew,
and reject reuse with another binding or key. Reuse with the same
binding and key MUST NOT be rejected solely because the JWT or its
`jti` was previously seen; all current validation and status checks
still apply. A client changing keys needs a newly issued platform
JWT with a different signing input, such as a new `iat` or `jti`.
Validation errors use `invalid_grant` under {{RFC8693}}; errors in
separate client authentication retain their base processing.

Clients using cached platform JWTs MUST retain the associated DPoP key
for reuse. If that key is lost, the client needs a platform credential
with a different signing input or another independently authenticated,
approved binding. A platform that cannot issue a fresh credential or
target the IdP audience can expose a token-exchange service or act as
an ATTEST attester. The IdP MUST NOT reset the reuse association merely
because the caller supplies a new key. These deployment prerequisites
limit which platform credentials can be used directly.

### Client Authentication for Platform Evidence {#platform-client}

For direct platform-JWT-to-WAG exchange, the IdP MAY permit requests
without OAuth client authentication or identification, as allowed by
{{RFC8693, Section 2.1}}. This does not waive validation of the platform
JWT, DPoP nonce and key association, or agent authorization. A binding
configured to require client authentication MUST NOT permit its omission.

Acquisition of an IdP access token from platform evidence and every
subsequent exchange using that token MUST authenticate the OAuth client.
The client MUST use a separately configured OAuth authentication method,
such as `private_key_jwt` under {{OIDC}} and {{RFC7523}}, or ATTEST.
The request MUST include the authenticated `client_id`; an unauthenticated
`client_id` MUST NOT be accepted on the platform evidence path. The IdP
MUST verify that the Federation Binding permits that client. A DPoP
proof or a mapped platform identity MUST NOT satisfy this check.
Requests using a platform-origin IdP access token MUST also include
the server-provided DPoP nonce required by {{platform-jwt-input}}.

A JWT used for client authentication MUST satisfy that method's client
identity and key requirements independently of the platform JWT. For
RFC 7523 client authentication, `sub` MUST be the OAuth `client_id`.
For ATTEST used solely in this role, its client authentication rules
apply; it does not independently select the Registered Agent or supply
instance context for the platform evidence path. No new client
authentication method or assertion type is defined here.

### Client Attestation {#agent-evidence}

The client MUST use `attest_jwt_client_auth_dpop` under {{ATTEST}}.
The Client Attestation MUST include nonempty strings for `iss` and
`sub=client_id`, and both `iat` and the ATTEST-required `exp` as
NumericDates. It MUST use an approved
asymmetric algorithm with a `kid` resolvable through trusted attester
configuration. Implementations MUST support `ES256`. The IdP MUST
configure a maximum attestation age and lifetime for each approved
attester. Request freshness comes from the DPoP proof and the
per-issuance status checks in {{idp-access-token}}, not from a
short-lived attestation. The IdP MUST reject missing or incorrectly
typed required claims or `iat` not preceding `exp` using
`invalid_client_attestation`, and MUST reject an attestation outside
its configured age or lifetime limits as not fresh enough using
`use_fresh_attestation`, both under {{ATTEST}}.

When the client represents the agent, the attestation MUST omit
`agent_id`. A shared client MUST include `agent_id`, a nonempty
StringOrURI {{RFC7519}} naming the agent in the attester's namespace.
The attester MUST verify authorized execution of that agent and
possession of the key in `cnf.jwk`. The IdP MUST validate the
attestation and combined-mode proof under ATTEST, including the
match between the DPoP key and `cnf.jwk`, before resolving the binding.

### SPIFFE X.509-SVID {#spiffe-input}

The client MUST authenticate using `spiffe_x509` under
{{SPIFFE-OAUTH, Section 3.2}}, with `client_id` equal to the exact
SPIFFE ID in the certificate's URI SAN. The IdP MUST validate the
SVID and trust bundle under that specification and resolve the
approved trust-domain and identity binding in {{identity}}. This
input represents the agent as client.

A separate DPoP proof establishes the token-binding key. This key
MAY differ from the SVID's TLS key. Both proofs MUST be validated
in the same authenticated token request. At exchange, a renewed SVID
MAY authenticate the same SPIFFE ID under the same approved binding;
the DPoP key MUST still match the access token.

WIT-SVID uses the separate binding in {{wit-input}}. A JWT-SVID lacks
the `iss` claim {{RFC7523}} requires and remains outside this profile.

### SPIFFE WIT-SVID {#wit-input}

The client MUST authenticate using `spiffe_wit` under
{{SPIFFE-OAUTH, Section 3.3}}. It MUST send the WIT-SVID directly in
`OAuth-Client-Attestation` and a fresh Client Attestation PoP JWT in
`OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP`, with `client_id` equal to the exact
SPIFFE ID in the WIT's `sub`. This input represents the agent as
client. The requirements specific to {{agent-evidence}} do not apply
to this input.

The IdP MUST validate the WIT under {{WIT}}, including `typ=wit+jwt`,
expiration, signature, and the public key and proof algorithm in
`cnf.jwk`. It MUST use trust anchors configured for the trust domain
in `sub` and resolve the exact binding in {{identity}}. The optional
`iss` claim MUST NOT select trust anchors or replace that lookup;
its absence alone MUST NOT cause rejection.

The IdP MUST validate the Client Attestation PoP JWT under {{ATTEST}},
including the IdP issuer as audience, freshness, and any required
challenge. The request MUST also include the DPoP proof required by
{{inputs}}. Both proofs MUST use the WIT's `cnf.jwk` key and its
`alg` value. The IdP MUST compare keys using their {{RFC7638}}
thumbprints and reject a mismatch. Implementations MUST support
`ES256`. The separate proofs authenticate the client and establish
the token binding respectively; DPoP alone MUST NOT replace the
Client Attestation PoP JWT in this input. Validation errors use
the applicable ATTEST or DPoP errors.

A renewed WIT-SVID MAY authenticate an exchange using an existing
eligible IdP access token only if its identity binding and proof key
remain the same. A changed WIT key requires new acquisition only when
using the IdP access-token path; a direct WAG request instead proves
the new WIT key under {{direct-wag}}. Because
{{WIT}} recommends a fresh key for each WIT, reuse across renewal is
expected only where a deployment retains the key. The issuance
lifetime limit in {{idp-access-token}} applies to the access token,
not to the WIT's original lifetime.

## Optional Instance Identification {#instance-identification}

An ATTEST deployment MAY configure {{INSTANCE}} when it needs
installation or execution correlation. If configured, the IdP MUST
validate that profile, its lifecycle granularity, and any applicable
instance status before accepting the request. If instance context
is carried in the IdP access token, subsequent exchange MUST validate
matching context from current evidence. Missing required or conflicting
context MUST cause rejection. Without this extension, no stable
instance identifier is required and unvalidated instance claims
MUST NOT be copied into issued tokens.

## IdP Access Token {#idp-access-token}

This short-lived, DPoP-bound token carries the IdP's canonical
Registered Agent identity. It is an exchange adapter or actor
credential, not the access token used at a downstream API. Acquisition
is specified in {{bootstrap}}.

An unexpired access token that this IdP issued under {{bootstrap}} to
the same client, Registered Agent, input method, and DPoP key MAY be
reused for exchange. No other access token is eligible; a matching
audience or a caller-supplied claim does not make one eligible. The
IdP MUST NOT require reacquisition of a token that remains
eligible.

The issued access token MUST conform to {{RFC9068}} and contain:

| Claim | Required value |
|---|---|
| `iss` | IdP issuer identifier |
| `sub` | Resolved Registered Agent identifier |
| `client_id` | Authenticated logical client identifier |
| `aud` | IdP issuer identifier, identifying the exchange service |
| `sub_profile` | `ai_agent` under {{ENTITY-PROFILES}} |
| `cnf.jkt` | SHA-256 JWK thumbprint of the proven DPoP key under {{RFC7638}} |

The IdP's token endpoint is the resource for this token. `resource` in
the request and `aud` in the token both name the IdP issuer identifier
under {{RFC8707}} and {{RFC9068}}, and the token is accepted only as
`subject_token` or `actor_token` at that endpoint.

An eligible token MUST NOT contain `act`; a token that already carries
an actor would add a second actor hop at exchange. A token issued by
this acquisition MUST have a lifetime of at most 300 seconds. The
platform JWT, attestation, or SVID was valid at issuance; its remaining
validity does not bound the token. The short lifetime keeps the token a transient
exchange input rather than a standing credential, so no refresh token
is issued and a revoked binding takes effect at the next acquisition
or exchange once applied at the IdP.
The IdP MUST associate it with the Federation Binding, input method,
source tenant, and exchange authorization through trusted issuance
policy or token state. Validated `client_instance` MAY be included
under {{instance-identification}}.

# Requesting an Authorization Grant {#exchange}

The client MUST use {{RFC8693}} at the IdP token endpoint with its
evidence and client authentication under {{inputs}}. When an IdP access token
is presented, the logical client MUST match the one that obtained it.

The DPoP proof establishes the issued grant's binding key. For direct
JWT input, the credential and proof checks in {{inputs}} and
{{direct-wag}} apply. For an IdP access token presented as
`subject_token` or `actor_token`, the proof key MUST match its
`cnf.jkt`. No `ath` is required for these token-endpoint exchanges;
this document defines the input-key checks in addition to {{RFC9449}}.
The IdP SHOULD issue server-provided nonces under
{{RFC9449, Section 8}} for acquisition and exchange requests so that
proofs cannot be generated in advance; this is REQUIRED for the
platform JWT input under {{platform-jwt-input}}.

Examples abbreviate cryptographic values and omit HTTP framing
headers. Line breaks in form bodies are for display only.
Examples using platform JWTs assume the client already obtained the
required IdP nonce; the displayed DPoP proof includes that nonce.

In both outputs:

* `grant_type` is `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange`.
* `audience` MUST be exactly one target RAS issuer identifier.
* `resource` MUST be exactly one resource {{RFC8707}} at that RAS.
* `scope` MUST contain a nonempty set of requested resource scopes.

This profile does not support `authorization_details` {{RFC9396}}; its
presence MUST cause `invalid_request`. Scope is the only authorization
granularity both grants carry in this version; a Rich Authorization
Requests profile for agent grants is left to a future document.

## Selecting an Exchange Input {#paths}

| Output and evidence input | Exchange input | Acquisition |
|---|---|---|
| WAG; platform JWT, ATTEST, or WIT-SVID | The JWT credential as `subject_token`, type `jwt` | Not required; preferred path |
| WAG; X.509-SVID | IdP access token as `subject_token`, type `access_token` | Required unless an eligible token is held |
| WAG; another supported input with an eligible IdP access token | IdP access token as `subject_token`, type `access_token` | Reuse the existing token |
| ID-JAG; any supported input | User credential as `subject_token`; IdP access token as `actor_token` | Required unless an eligible actor token is held; platform evidence requires separate client authentication |

The abbreviated token types in this table use the
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:` prefix.

## Self-Acting Agent {#self-exchange}

`requested_token_type` MUST be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:wag`.
Neither actor parameter is permitted. The client MUST use one of the
subject inputs below. The issued WAG is specified in {{wag-profile}}
and its identifiers are registered in {{iana}}.

### Direct JWT Credential {#direct-wag}

`subject_token_type` MUST be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`.
The IdP MUST validate the `subject_token` under its configured input:

| Input | Presentation | Identity resolved by the IdP |
|---|---|---|
| Platform JWT | `subject_token` only; separate client authentication when required | Approved issuer and exact configured identity claims |
| Client Attestation | Same JWT in `subject_token` and `OAuth-Client-Attestation` | Approved `(iss, sub)` or shared-client `(iss, sub, agent_id)` binding |
| WIT-SVID | Same JWT in `subject_token` and `OAuth-Client-Attestation` | Approved trust domain and exact SPIFFE ID in `sub` |

For ATTEST and WIT-SVID, the IdP MUST reject a different JWT in
`subject_token` with `invalid_grant`, even if both JWTs identify the
same agent. The generic JWT token type MUST NOT select an input or
relax its validation requirements. Trusted configuration determines
credential type, issuer or trust-domain validation, identity mapping,
and required proofs under {{inputs}}. A direct input carrying `act`
MUST be rejected with `invalid_grant`; this path represents a
self-acting agent.

These checks establish subject evidence, not permission to obtain
WAG. The IdP MUST resolve the Registered Agent under {{identity}} and
apply {{idp-processing}} before issuance. The resulting WAG `sub` is
that Registered Agent's identifier. It MUST NOT be copied from an
external `sub`, `client_id`, or instance identifier merely because
that value was authenticated. This rule also applies to a shared
client: `agent_id` selects an approved binding and does not itself
grant authority. Optional instance context follows
{{instance-identification}}.

For ATTEST and WIT-SVID, the DPoP key MUST match the credential's
`cnf.jwk` under the selected input. Platform JWTs retain the bearer
credential and DPoP association rules in {{platform-jwt-input}}.
For ATTEST and WIT-SVID the same JWT also authenticates the client.
No additional credential issuance is required for any direct JWT input.

Example direct exchange using Client Attestation:

&scope=tickets.read
~~~

### IdP Access Token {#wag-access-token}

Where supported under {{bootstrap}}, `subject_token` MAY instead be
an eligible IdP-issued access token, with
`subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
The IdP MUST apply the token and current-authentication checks in
{{idp-processing}}. X.509-SVID uses this path because its TLS proof
supplies no JWT subject token. {{spiffe-flow}} shows the complete flow.

## Agent Acting for a User {#delegated-exchange}

`requested_token_type` MUST be
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag`. `actor_token` MUST be
the IdP-issued access token, with
`actor_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
The IdP MUST apply Actor Profile's JWT access-token actor-input
processing. The token's `sub` identifies the Registered Agent;
its instance context does not supply `act.sub`. Acquisition under
{{bootstrap}} is required when no eligible actor token is available.
The direct JWT input in {{direct-wag}} applies only to self-acting
WAG; it does not change Actor Profile's actor-input rules.

`subject_token` MUST be a user credential accepted under {{ID-JAG}}.
Implementations MUST support an OpenID Connect ID Token with
`subject_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token`.
Other inputs permitted by ID-JAG MAY be supported with their
validation and authorization limits. Inputs carrying an existing
`act` chain MUST be rejected, not erased or extended.

For a shared client, the user credential was issued to the shared
client and cannot distinguish the agents behind it. The delegation
approval verified in {{idp-processing}} is the only element that names
the acting agent. The IdP MUST NOT issue an ID-JAG for a shared-client
agent without an approval that names that agent.

## IdP Processing {#idp-processing}

Before issuance, the IdP MUST:

1. Validate the DPoP proof and any required client authentication
   under {{inputs}}. For direct WAG, validate the subject evidence
   under {{direct-wag}} and resolve its Federation Binding.
2. For an IdP access-token input, validate its signature, issuer,
   audience, lifetime, and eligibility under {{idp-access-token}};
   match its client and key to the current request. Resolve the
   recorded external binding and verify its current association with
   the recorded agent, source tenant, and input method. For ATTEST
   and SPIFFE, current authentication MUST match that binding. For
   platform JWT origin, apply {{platform-client}} to the recorded
   binding; no platform JWT is required again and the actor token
   MUST NOT serve as client authentication. In either path, validate
   any required instance context under {{instance-identification}}
   and reject inconsistent evidence.
3. Check current agent status, credential-authority trust, external binding,
   application assignment, and permitted output. Validate the
   RAS/resource association and determine an authorized nonempty
   subset of the requested scopes.
4. For delegation, validate the user credential under {{ID-JAG}},
   including audience/client checks and applicable scope ceilings.
   Resolve the user and downstream client. Verify user-approved
   or administrator-authorized delegation for this Registered
   Agent, user, client context, resource, and scope. Two valid
   credentials alone MUST NOT establish that authorization.
5. Construct the grant under {{grant}} using the resolved principal
   and proven key, with no broader authority than authorized above.

The approval user interface and storage mechanism are outside this
profile. The IdP MUST validate an authenticated approval record or
policy decision binding the issuer-qualified agent, user, logical
client, Source and Target Tenants, target RAS, resource, and permitted
scopes. It MUST verify the approving user's or administrator's
authority, current validity, and revocation status on every issuance.
Approval MUST NOT be inferred from sign-in or the client's possession
of both credentials. A shared client MUST NOT let one agent use
another's approval. Missing or invalid approval MUST prevent issuance.

## Grant Construction {#grant}

The IdP MUST issue a signed JWT under the selected output rules below,
with an approved asymmetric algorithm and a `kid`
resolvable through trusted issuer configuration. Implementations
MUST support `ES256` {{RFC7518}} in addition to requirements of
the underlying specifications.

The grant MUST contain the IdP's issuer in `iss`, the exact target RAS
issuer in `aud`, and the approved `resource` and `scope`. `cnf.jkt`
MUST equal the thumbprint of the validated DPoP key. The grant
lifetime MUST NOT exceed 300 seconds. For ID-JAG it MUST NOT exceed
the remaining validity of the accepted user credential or of the
applicable delegation. The agent credential or IdP access token MUST
be valid at exchange; its remaining validity does not bound the grant.
The IdP
MUST assign a unique `jti` and MUST NOT reuse `(iss, jti)`.

For WAG, the claims and processing in {{wag-profile}} apply.

For ID-JAG, the JWT MUST conform to {{ID-JAG}}, with `sub` resolved
under its user subject-mapping rules. Actor Profile construction MUST
introduce exactly one actor, with `act.iss` equal to the IdP issuer,
`act.sub` equal to the IdP-issued actor token's `sub`, and
`act.sub_profile=ai_agent`. The ID-JAG MUST
include the downstream `client_id` and other required ID-JAG claims,
including applicable tenant context. Translating a client identifier
MUST NOT rewrite the agent actor's namespace. ID-JAG's
issuer-identifier audience rule governs this output rather than Actor
Profile's generic token-endpoint audience rule.

The IdP MAY include `client_instance` for downstream audit or risk.
It MUST be omitted unless current instance evidence was validated
under {{instance-identification}}. The mapped form in {{INSTANCE}}
is RECOMMENDED: `iss` is the IdP issuer and `id` is an unambiguous
IdP-assigned reference, preferably scoped to the recipient. The
pass-through form MAY be used only with the recipient trust
configuration and validation required by INSTANCE. Recipients whose
processing depends on lifecycle granularity MUST establish it under
INSTANCE; correlation alone does not require that knowledge. The object describes
the subject's instance for WAG and the actor's instance for ID-JAG.
On token issuance from a grant, the RAS MUST preserve that association
and validate or remap the context under INSTANCE; it MUST NOT copy
an IdP-mapped context under a new token issuer without an approved
pass-through relationship or its own unambiguous mapping.

### Workload Authorization Grant Issued by an IdP {#wag-profile}

WAG defines the grant concept, the Agent Identifier, a per-tenancy
issuer model, RFC 7523 redemption, and Agent Properties, and names
issuance by an enterprise IdP through token exchange as a composition
it leaves open. This section defines that composition. A WAG issued
under this document:

* is requested with
  `requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:wag` and
  returned with that `issued_token_type` ({{iana}});
* carries the JOSE header `typ=oauth-wag+jwt`, which the RAS MUST
  validate under {{RFC8725}};
* has `iss` equal to the IdP's issuer identifier for the Source
  Tenant. The IdP takes WAG's per-tenancy issuer role: it MUST use a
  distinct issuer identifier and distinct signing keys per Source
  Tenant; tenant issuers MUST NOT share signing keys. It MUST publish
  each issuer's keys through that issuer's metadata. The RAS MUST
  select an allowlisted exact `iss` first and validate only against
  keys authorized for that issuer. Key caches MUST retain the issuer
  association; `kid` alone or a union of tenant key sets MUST NOT
  select a verification key. `sub` and `jti` are interpreted only
  within that `iss`, as WAG requires;
* has `sub` equal to the Registered Agent identifier resolved under
  {{idp-processing}}, whether the input was a direct JWT credential
  or an IdP access token. This value is WAG's Agent Identifier: opaque, unique within `iss`,
  immutable, and never reassigned. It MAY take the URI form WAG
  recommends, with an authority component under the IdP's tenant
  issuer; the RAS MUST treat it as an exact-match opaque string in
  either form;
* has `sub_profile=ai_agent` under {{ENTITY-PROFILES}};
* has `aud` equal to the RAS issuer identifier. WAG recommends
  carrying both the issuer identifier and the token endpoint URL;
  this document carries the issuer identifier alone, which every
  WAG-conformant RAS MUST accept, so WAG and ID-JAG share one
  audience rule;
* carries `scope` and `resource` with the approved values, using the
  claim definitions in {{ID-JAG}}; both are REQUIRED here;
* carries `cnf` with `jkt` ({{RFC7800}}) equal to the thumbprint of
  the proven DPoP key. This closes WAG's open proof-of-possession
  item for IdP-issued grants: the grant is not a bearer grant and
  MUST be redeemed with a DPoP proof under {{consumption}};
* MUST NOT contain `act`;
* MAY carry WAG's Agent Properties. `groups` and `roles` use their
  {{RFC9068}} definitions and `name` its OpenID Connect definition
  {{OIDC}}; `namespace` and `ctx` are WAG placeholders pending
  registration. Values come from the Registered Agent record and its
  memberships at the IdP. `name` MUST NOT be used as a key for
  authorization or attribution. `groups` and `roles` describe the
  agent, never a user;
* carries `jti`, `iat`, and `exp` under {{grant}}.

Registration and provisioning at the RAS follow WAG: a RAS MUST NOT
require the agent to be projected into it before first issuance and
MUST accept a previously unseen `sub` under an allowlisted `iss`.
Authorization that depends on a provisioned agent record follows
{{agent-correlation}} and MAY be withheld until the record exists. RAS
policy selects between property-based authorization under WAG and
record-based authorization under {{agent-correlation}}. Agent
Properties supplied by the IdP are inputs to that policy, not
entitlements; the RAS MUST NOT treat them as authoritative unless its
configuration for that issuer says so.

## Response and Errors

The response follows {{RFC8693}}. `issued_token_type` MUST equal
the requested output type, `token_type` MUST be `N_A`, and
`access_token` contains the grant. `expires_in` gives its remaining
lifetime and `scope` lists approved scopes. No refresh token is issued.

The client MUST verify the returned type and the grant's protected
JWT type, audience, resource, scope subset, and `cnf.jkt` for its
proven key. A mismatch MUST cause failure. These checks do not
replace cryptographic grant validation at the RAS.

Malformed requests and unsupported outputs or combinations use
`invalid_request`. Disallowed actor chains use `invalid_grant` under
Actor Profile. Invalid exchange credentials or
inconsistent bindings use `invalid_grant`; invalid targets and
scopes use `invalid_target` and `invalid_scope`. Missing or
prohibited delegation for a validated actor uses `actor_unauthorized`
under {{ACTOR-PROFILE}}. The IdP MUST validate client and subject
credentials before evaluating or disclosing delegation status. For a
validated request, absent, revoked, expired, and insufficient approval
MUST produce the same `actor_unauthorized` response without user,
agent, assignment, or approval details. Error descriptions and
response timing SHOULD NOT distinguish those causes. This is not an
approval-discovery interface. A client not permitted to use this profile
receives `unauthorized_client`. Input authentication and DPoP
freshness errors retain their base processing. A failed delegated
request MUST NOT produce a self-acting grant.

# Obtaining an IdP Access Token When Needed {#bootstrap}

This acquisition supplies the X.509-SVID exchange adapter and the
canonical actor credential for delegated ID-JAG. It is also available
for WAG with any input when the deployment supports the access-token
path. JWT credentials can
be exchanged directly for WAG under {{direct-wag}}; the IdP MUST NOT
require acquisition before accepting that path.

When this path is needed and no eligible token is available, the
client obtains one using the request below. This step establishes an
IdP principal for use as the WAG exchange subject or ID-JAG actor evidence. It does not replace authentication
or current authorization checks on subsequent requests.

Example decoded Client Attestation payload for an agent with its
own client identity. The IdP maps this client to `agent-42`; the
subsequent requests and grants use that binding.

~~~ json
{
  "iss": "https://attester.example/tenant/acme",
  "sub": "https://platform.example/agents/support-agent-7",
  "iat": 1789128000,
  "exp": 1789128300,
  "cnf": {
    "jwk": {
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "x": "VcKVNBZ4IaBAYW3jxM4w3TJFVA7myeUGQyGt-g_yvpQ",
      "y": "f-E-hYE3TAWKwhVv9pej9NABs9SX9XsNO80x57jFTyU"
    }
  }
}
~~~

For a shared client, the attestation instead uses that client's
identifier, such as `https://platform.example/oauth-client`, as
`sub` and includes `"agent_id": "support-agent-7"`. The request's
`client_id` matches that shared client identifier. The approved
binding can resolve to the same `agent-42` in either model.

## Request

ATTEST and SPIFFE clients MUST use the client credentials grant with
`resource` equal to the IdP issuer identifier and authentication under
{{inputs}}. Platform JWT input instead uses {{platform-acquisition}}.
The example uses ATTEST without optional instance identification.

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1

&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example%2Ftenant%2Facme
~~~

### Acquisition from Platform JWT Evidence {#platform-acquisition}

The client MUST use token exchange with the platform JWT as
`subject_token`, type `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:jwt`, and
`requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
`resource` MUST equal the IdP issuer identifier. The request MUST NOT
include `audience`, `scope`, or actor parameters; the token's only
purpose is the exchange service described in {{idp-access-token}}.
The IdP MUST validate the platform JWT under {{platform-jwt-input}},
the separate client authentication under {{platform-client}}, and
the DPoP proof before binding the Registered Agent and client to the
issued token. The platform JWT MUST NOT be used with `client_credentials`.

This acquisition is REQUIRED for platform-based delegated ID-JAG
when no eligible actor token is held. It is optional for self-acting
WAG and MUST NOT be required before direct exchange.

## Processing and Response

The IdP MUST validate the configured input and DPoP proof, resolve
the Federation Binding, and verify that the Registered Agent is
active and permitted to use this client and exchange service.

The issued token MUST satisfy {{idp-access-token}}. Its issuance does
not authorize skipping authentication or current-policy checks at exchange.

For client credentials, the response follows {{RFC6749}}. For platform
JWT exchange, it follows {{RFC8693}} and also includes
`issued_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token`.
Both use `token_type=DPoP` and `expires_in`, with no refresh token.
Clients need not parse the access token. It MAY be
reused with fresh proofs until expiry; renewal or key rotation
requires new issuance. An instance identifier MUST NOT authorize
rebinding an existing token to a different key.

~~~ json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...agent-access-token...",
  "token_type": "DPoP",
  "expires_in": 300
}
~~~

# Grant Consumption {#consumption}

Redemption uses the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`
grant with the JWT in `assertion` under {{RFC7523}}, as both
{{ID-JAG}} and {{WAG}} require, accompanied by the DPoP proof required
below. The bound-grant checks below apply. The redemption request MUST
include `resource` {{RFC8707}} equal to the grant's `resource` claim;
the RAS MUST reject a mismatch with `invalid_target`. Other processing
follows {{ID-JAG}} for delegated output and {{WAG}} as profiled in
{{wag-profile}} for self-acting output. Delegated processing
additionally follows Actor Profile, including preservation of `act`.
This document does not define a separate redemption protocol,
access-token format, or introspection schema. Downstream access-token
lifetimes and refresh behavior follow the underlying grant and
resource authorization policy.

For ID-JAG, the client MUST authenticate to the RAS using a credential
registered or otherwise trusted for the downstream `client_id` in
the grant. The RAS MUST enforce ID-JAG's client match independently
of the grant's DPoP binding. An IdP's client-ID mapping does not
provision that credential. DPoP possession alone MUST NOT be treated
as client authentication. The examples use `private_key_jwt` under
{{RFC7523}} and explain the separate credential in {{ras-auth}}.

For WAG, the `resource` requirement above satisfies WAG's redemption
parameter. WAG leaves client identity unspecified. Under this document
the DPoP proof supplies the possession check, and the RAS MAY
additionally require client authentication by configuration. The RAS
MUST make any Agent Properties in the grant available to the resource
server's authorization decision and MUST NOT issue a refresh token for
a WAG, as WAG requires. A grant that fails validation, including a
missing or mismatched DPoP proof, is rejected with `invalid_grant`;
scopes beyond the grant use `invalid_scope`.

Every grant is bound to the proven DPoP key. The IdP MUST issue only
to a RAS configured to validate that binding. The client MUST present
a fresh DPoP proof at redemption. The RAS MUST validate it under
{{RFC9449}} and reject a missing or invalid proof or a key that does
not match `cnf.jkt`, using ID-JAG's bound-grant processing for ID-JAG
and the same checks for WAG. The RAS MUST accept each grant at most
once, retaining consumed `(iss, jti)` values through `exp` plus the
maximum allowed clock skew across its validators, and MUST reject a
replayed grant with `invalid_grant`. Replay checks and consumption
MUST be atomic across the RAS's token-endpoint replicas. The RAS MUST issue
a sender-constrained access token, such as a DPoP-bound token under
{{RFC9449}}, when redeeming a grant issued under this profile, and
MUST NOT issue a bearer access token from it. That access token,
rather than an upstream credential or grant, is used at the resource
server.

## Continuing Delegated Access {#delegated-lifecycle}

A background agent needs continuing user authorization as well as its
own credential. This profile issues no refresh token during agent
acquisition or grant exchange; that does not prohibit the IdP from
issuing a user-session refresh token during OpenID Connect sign-in.
Under {{ID-JAG}}, the RAS SHOULD NOT issue a refresh token by default.
An unexpired, unconsumed ID-JAG can be redeemed once; this profile's
single-use requirement precludes ID-JAG's optional grant reuse.

When another grant is needed, the client MUST obtain a new ID-JAG
using a currently valid user credential and eligible agent actor
token. An IdP MAY accept a user-session refresh token as
`subject_token` under ID-JAG, or use that refresh token to issue a new
ID Token through the normal OpenID Connect flow. The IdP MUST enforce
the refresh token's client binding, current validity, scope ceiling,
and revocation status as well as the agent's current approval. A
refresh token with no fixed expiration does not extend the 300-second
grant limit or override a shorter approval lifetime. If no eligible
user credential can be obtained, the agent MUST stop delegated
issuance and obtain renewed user authorization through the IdP.

A deployment that intentionally permits RAS-issued refresh tokens
under ID-JAG MAY continue access using those tokens, subject to their
client and sender bindings and the RAS's current authorization policy.
That is a separately configured lifecycle, not the default here.

## Agent Record Correlation {#agent-correlation}

The canonical Registered Agent identity is the exact pair of IdP
issuer and agent identifier. For a WAG issued here, the pair is
`(iss, sub)`; for delegated ID-JAG it is `(act.iss, act.sub)`. A RAS
using provisioned agent records MUST resolve both forms through
the same issuer-qualified mapping. It MUST NOT key that lookup on
bare `sub`, the OAuth client, or instance context. Missing or ambiguous
mappings MUST prevent authorization that depends on that record.

Provisioning protocols and policy rules remain deployment choices.
If SCIM `externalId` is used, the provisioning relationship MUST
associate it with the IdP issuer so another issuer's equal string
cannot resolve to the same agent accidentally. Group membership
resolved for this agent MUST NOT be attributed to an ID-JAG user,
or user membership to the agent. {{provisioning-example}} illustrates
this contract without defining new SCIM attributes.

# Metadata and Configuration {#metadata}

The IdP MUST advertise token exchange, `client_credentials` when it
supports client-credentials acquisition under {{bootstrap}}, and its
implemented client authentication methods (`attest_jwt_client_auth_dpop`,
`spiffe_x509`, or `spiffe_wit`) through existing {{RFC8414}} and
input-specification metadata, and DPoP `ES256` support under
{{RFC9449}}. Support for the platform-issued JWT input has no
client authentication method of its own; it uses token exchange and
trusted platform issuer and claim-mapping configuration. IdPs supporting
{{platform-acquisition}} MUST also advertise the separately supported
client authentication methods through existing metadata. Profile
selection and approved identity bindings use the configuration in {{identity}}.
Delegated implementations use Actor Profile's existing metadata for ID
Token subject input, JWT access-token actor input, and supported
entity profiles, including `ai_agent`. The IdP advertises its
supported outputs, `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id-jag` and
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:wag`, through
`identity_chaining_requested_token_types_supported`, referenced by
{{ID-JAG}} and defined in {{IDENTITY-CHAINING}}.

RAS capabilities are advertised under the selected grant and, where
applicable, Actor Profile. A RAS advertises
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` in
`grant_types_supported` under {{RFC8414}}, as ID-JAG and WAG require,
and its DPoP support under {{RFC9449}}. The IdP MUST verify the
configured RAS supports the required grant, binding, and actor
processing before issuance. No new grant-profile identifier, metadata
parameter, bootstrap scope, or token marker is defined here. Metadata
discovery does not establish issuer trust or delegation authority.

# Security and Privacy Considerations {#security}

All credential acquisition, exchange, and redemption requests MUST
use HTTPS with server certificate validation; credentials and proofs
MUST NOT be placed in URLs. DPoP does not replace transport protection.
Validators under this profile MUST configure clock skew no greater
than 30 seconds and MUST NOT use skew to increase the permitted
`exp - iat` lifetime. A grant audience MUST be exactly one RAS issuer;
additional audiences MUST be rejected. This confines each grant to
one verifier and prevents reusing it across trust boundaries.

Single-use processing prevents even the legitimate key holder from
minting multiple access tokens from one grant. A short expiration and
DPoP proof alone do not prevent that replay. Sender constraint also
prevents a stolen grant from being redeemed without its key and
prevents a stolen downstream access token from being used without
its key. These checks complement current authorization policy;
neither establishes the agent's assignments.

A compromised tenant issuer can forge subjects and properties within
its own namespace, including previously unseen agents. Accepting an
unseen WAG subject does not authorize access: the RAS MUST apply its
issuer-specific resource and property policy before issuing a token.
It MUST NOT let an issuer assert another issuer's agents, memberships,
or Target Tenant. Distinct tenant keys and issuer-bound validation
limit cross-tenant forgery but do not protect against compromise of
the IdP's shared control plane. The IdP MUST isolate signing authority
so that control of one tenant does not permit signing for another.

The security requirements of the selected input, {{RFC8693}},
{{RFC8725}}, and selected output apply; {{INSTANCE}} additionally
applies when configured. The IdP MUST bind agent, tenant, and key,
plus the authenticated client when required and any validated instance
context, to one authorized request. Independently valid evidence for different agents or
identified instances MUST NOT be combined. A stable instance identifier does
not authorize key rebinding or establish a delegation relationship.

The IdP MUST check current status and authorization on each issuance,
including credential-authority trust, agent bindings, assignments,
and delegation.
It MUST define freshness limits for cached authorization data and
reject data exceeding those limits. A disabled agent or revoked
binding MUST prevent new issuance once applied at the IdP, even if
an earlier access token remains unexpired. This does not promise
immediate revocation of downstream access tokens. The IdP SHOULD
propagate disabled status or withdrawn assignments through configured
provisioning or security-event channels. Once a RAS receives and
validates such a change, it SHOULD revoke affected access and refresh
tokens, or report them inactive through introspection, and MUST apply
the change to subsequent grant and refresh processing. A resource
server enforcing that status SHOULD deny affected requests. These
rules do not define a new notification protocol or guarantee delivery.
Without a signal, a resource server can continue accepting an issued
access token until its expiration. Deployments permitting refresh
tokens also need a status check or revocation mechanism at renewal;
access-token expiration alone does not end that continued access.

Configured requirements for agent identity, key binding, or explicit
actors MUST NOT be bypassed by choosing an existing client-based
flow. Supplying only a shared client identity does not authenticate
an agent underneath it. Successful grant redemption does not justify
adding an actor hop merely because a runtime or server participated.

The agent binding established here ends where the grant is consumed.
A bearer access token minted from a bound grant would let any holder
act as the attested agent, so {{consumption}} requires
sender-constrained downstream tokens. Sender constraint does not
replace the RAS's own authorization checks.

In the shared-client model one attester asserts `agent_id` for every
agent behind the client, and nothing in the client's own credentials
limits which `agent_id` values it can name. A compromised or
mistakenly trusted attester can therefore obtain grants for any agent
under that client, across every tenant it serves. Deployments SHOULD
use a distinct `client_id` per tenant or governance boundary, SHOULD
limit each attester's approved bindings to the agents it governs, and
MUST enforce withdrawal of attester trust on subsequent
authentication. The attester `iss` SHOULD be retained with each
issuance for audit.

A platform-issued JWT establishes workload identity without a key of
its own; it does not authenticate an OAuth client. Theft before its
first use can let an attacker establish the initial key association; subsequent key matching does not prevent
that race. Audience restriction to the IdP, configured age limits,
and transport protection limit this exposure. The reuse association
in {{platform-jwt-input}} prevents an already-used JWT from enrolling
another key; it excludes the signature so another valid signature
over the same content does not bypass the check. Platforms MUST NOT
share one cached JWT among clients using independent DPoP keys.
Platform tokens with long lifetimes SHOULD be constrained by a short
configured maximum age. A compromised or mistakenly approved platform issuer can
impersonate every agent bound to it, so the same scoping and
withdrawal requirements apply to platform issuers as to attesters.
Changes to imported bindings alter which platform identity is which
agent and MUST be authenticated and audited.

Stable agent and instance identifiers can permit correlation.
The IdP SHOULD release only necessary context and retain internal
mappings for recipient-scoped instance references. Raw attestation
material and private keys MUST NOT appear in grants or audit logs.

The Registered Agent identifier is stable across every RAS. Where an
agent serves one user, such as a per-user desktop agent, `act.sub` or
the WAG `sub` becomes a cross-service identifier for that user even
where ID-JAG subject mapping is pairwise. The IdP SHOULD NOT let
per-user agent identifiers act as a cross-context user pseudonym
without a correlation requirement at the receiving RASes. This
profile uses the canonical Registered Agent identifier in WAG `sub`
and preserves it from the IdP actor token in ID-JAG `act.sub`;
the IdP MUST NOT substitute
a recipient-specific actor identifier during grant construction.
Deployments requiring pairwise agent identifiers need an additional
profile coordinated with Actor Profile before using this flow.
Recipient-scoped instance context remains available under {{grant}}.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

## JWT Claims Registration

This specification requests registration of `agent_id` in the
JWT Claims registry established by {{RFC7519}}, with description
"Attester-scoped agent principal identifier", reference
{{agent-evidence}}, and Change Controller IETF. Its value is a
nonempty StringOrURI. This claim distinguishes agents represented
by a shared ATTEST client. Platform JWT identity claims are selected
separately through the configuration in {{platform-jwt-input}}.

## Media Type Registration

This section registers the `application/oauth-wag+jwt` media type
{{RFC2046}} in the "Media Types" registry in the manner described in
{{RFC6838}}, using the `+jwt` structured syntax suffix {{RFC8417}}.
It is used as the JOSE `typ` value `oauth-wag+jwt` under {{RFC8725}}
to indicate that the content is a Workload Authorization Grant
issued under {{wag-profile}}.

* Type name: application
* Subtype name: oauth-wag+jwt
* Required parameters: n/a
* Optional parameters: n/a
* Encoding considerations: binary; a JWT is a sequence of
  base64url-encoded values separated by period characters
* Security considerations: see {{security}} and {{RFC8725}}

## OAuth URI Registration

This section registers `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:wag` in the
"OAuth URI" subregistry of the "OAuth Parameters" registry.

* URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:wag
* Common Name: Token type URI for a Workload Authorization Grant
* Change Controller: IETF
* Specification Document: This document

## Other Identifiers

`client_instance` is defined by {{INSTANCE}}; `act` follows
{{ACTOR-PROFILE}}; `ai_agent` is defined by {{ENTITY-PROFILES}}.
No new actor format, access-token type, or grant-profile URI is
registered.

# Deployment and Compatibility {#deployment}
{:numbered="false"}

This appendix is informative.

A deployment can adopt user-delegated ID-JAG first, adding Actor
Profile and this document's sender-binding and replay requirements
to its existing user federation. Self-acting WAG is a separate
capability: it requires issuer-based workload trust, new-subject
handling, bound grants, and the WAG definitions coordinated in
{{coordination}}. Supporting ID-JAG does not imply WAG support, and a
RAS need not implement both outputs. Implementations should negotiate
only the capabilities actually deployed.

Existing ID-JAG flows, including MCP
Enterprise-Managed Authorization {{EMA}}, can authorize a client
for a user without a separately represented agent. The user is the
subject and the client is identified through normal OAuth context.
Absence of `act` does not imply absence of authorization, a human
presenter, or self-acting access. Those deployments retain their
existing authentication and sender-constraint choices and need no
bootstrap from this specification.

CIMD {{CIMD}} can supply client metadata and a common client identifier
across servers. When the client itself is the explicit actor, Actor
Profile already defines JWT client assertion input, including reuse
of one JWT as `client_assertion` and `actor_token`. That path does not
require an additional IdP-issued access token or ATTEST. A shared
client identity does not distinguish separately governed agents.
Instance identification can add audit context to client-based flows
without introducing an actor.

Agent admission and provisioning can use administrative configuration,
JIT, or SCIM Agent resources {{SCIM-AGENT}} with {{RFC7644}}. A SCIM
`externalId` {{RFC7643}} can correlate a record with the IdP agent
identifier when issuer and tenant are retained. Groups, ownership,
and assignments are policy inputs; group claims about an ID-JAG user
do not describe the agent actor's memberships. Provisioning transport,
synchronization, policy engines, access-token formats, and introspection
{{RFC7662}} are deployment choices outside this profile.

Platform-issued JWTs follow {{platform-jwt-input}}; native SPIFFE
X.509-SVID and WIT-SVID authentication follow {{spiffe-input}} and
{{wit-input}}. Other credential types need explicit binding and proof
rules; support for one platform's tokens does not imply that every
token format is accepted. Direct WIT actor evidence under Actor
Profile is a different input path. It would need explicit
external-subject mapping and proof rules; it does not implicitly
substitute for the IdP access token here.

# End-to-End Deployment Examples {#flows}
{:numbered="false"}

This appendix is informative. A harness is the software executing
the agent and making OAuth requests. These examples separate its
hosting environment, authentication evidence, and acting relationship:

| Use case | Deployment | Evidence accepted by IdP | Identity model | Grant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent acting for itself | SPIFFE workload | X.509-SVID or WIT-SVID with their required proofs | Agent is the client | WAG |
| Agent acting for itself | Imported cloud or agent-platform agent | Platform-issued JWT and DPoP | Imported workload principal; no OAuth client required | WAG |
| Agent acting for itself | Managed platform | Platform Client Attestation and DPoP | Agents share a client | WAG |
| Agent acting for a user | Managed device | Enterprise Client Attestation and DPoP | Agent is the client | ID-JAG |
| Agent acting for a user | Managed platform | Platform Client Attestation and DPoP | Agents share a client | ID-JAG |
| Agent acting for a user | Imported cloud or agent-platform agent | Platform JWT, separate client credential, user credential, and DPoP | Imported agent with an authorized OAuth client | ID-JAG |

In each example, the IdP maintains the agent's status, owner, groups,
and application assignments. Before issuance, it establishes the
external identity binding and trusts the relevant credential issuer.
The RAS trusts the IdP at `https://idp.example/tenant/acme` as grant
issuer. Administrative configuration, JIT, or SCIM can establish
the downstream agent record, correlated by IdP issuer and agent
identifier. Receiving a grant does not by itself provision a record
or authorize every scope.

The examples request `tickets.read` at `https://api.app.example`
through the RAS `https://as.app.example`. Each harness controls its
own key, denoted `K`; `JKT(K)` denotes its thumbprint. JWKs sent to
attesters contain only public keys. IdP requests use the evidence and
any client authentication described in each example, with fresh proofs
for the respective endpoints. The illustrated RAS
issues DPoP access tokens bound to that key, satisfying the
sender-constraint requirement in {{consumption}}.

## Agent Acting for Itself {#self-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

The agent is the WAG subject; the flow ends with a
sender-constrained access token for the agent alone. JWT credentials
use direct exchange under {{direct-wag}}. The X.509-SVID example
first illustrates the adapter needed when no JWT credential is
available; the subsequent variants omit that acquisition step.

Direct JWT path:

### SPIFFE Workload with X.509-SVID {#spiffe-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

Use this model when the workload already has a SPIFFE identity
representing the agent. This example uses X.509-SVID client
authentication under {{spiffe-input}}, without a Client Attestation
or stable instance identifier. X.509-SVID uses {{bootstrap}} because
the TLS credential is not a JWT subject token. The WAG is specified
in {{wag-profile}}.

     |                 |<--------------- tickets ----------------|
~~~

1. The harness obtains an X.509-SVID for
   `spiffe://workloads.example/agents/support` from its Workload API.
   The IdP has approved that exact identity and trust domain for
   Registered Agent `agent-42`; trusting the domain alone does not
   admit every workload as that agent.
2. The harness sends a client credentials request to the IdP over
   mutually authenticated TLS, with that SPIFFE ID as `client_id`
   and the IdP issuer as `resource`. A DPoP proof establishes a
   separate application key `K`. The IdP validates the SVID using
   the configured SPIFFE trust bundle and resolves the agent binding.
3. Under {{idp-access-token}}, the IdP issues an access token with `sub=agent-42`, the SPIFFE ID as `client_id`, its own
   issuer as `aud`, and `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)`. The TLS credential
   authenticates the workload; `K` binds the issued token.
4. The harness requests WAG using that access token as
   `subject_token`, the target RAS as `audience`, and the API and
   scope above. It again authenticates with its SVID and proves
   possession of `K`. The IdP checks the current binding and policy
   before issuing WAG with `sub=agent-42` and no `act`.
5. The harness redeems WAG at the RAS with a fresh proof from `K`,
   receives the application access token, and calls the API. The
   downstream processing is described in {{app-consumption}}.

The illustrative bootstrap request is sent over the mutually
authenticated TLS connection established with the X.509-SVID:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...workload-key-proof...

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=spiffe%3A%2F%2Fworkloads.example%2Fagents%2Fsupport
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example%2Ftenant%2Facme
~~~

The harness then sends this exchange over mutually authenticated TLS,
using the same SPIFFE identity and DPoP key:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...workload-key-proof...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Atoken-exchange
&client_id=spiffe%3A%2F%2Fworkloads.example%2Fagents%2Fsupport
&requested_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Awag
&subject_token=eyJ...agent-access-token...
&subject_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Aaccess_token
&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fas.app.example
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.app.example
&scope=tickets.read
~~~

The resulting WAG payload appears in {{grant}}. The harness redeems
it at the RAS:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: as.app.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...grant-key-proof...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&assertion=eyJ...idp-wag...
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.app.example
~~~

~~~ json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...app-access-token...",
  "token_type": "DPoP",
  "expires_in": 600,
  "scope": "tickets.read"
}
~~~

The RAS validates `typ`, resolves the IdP's key by `iss` through its
allowlist, checks `aud`, lifetime, and `jti`, matches `resource` to
the grant, and compares the DPoP proof key to `cnf.jkt` under
{{consumption}}. It accepts `agent-42` even if it has not seen that
subject before, applies any Agent Properties and its provisioned
record under {{agent-correlation}}, and issues a DPoP-bound access
token with no refresh token. No client authentication is required
for this redemption.

A SPIFFE workload can have several instances {{SPIFFE-CONCEPTS}}.
This flow correlates key possession through `cnf.jkt`; it does not
claim a stable runtime identity. A renewed SVID can be used with an
existing eligible token when the approved SPIFFE binding and DPoP
key remain the same. An unrelated identity or replacement DPoP key
cannot use that token.

### WIT-SVID Variant
{:numbered="false"}

With {{wit-input}} configured, the harness instead obtains a WIT-SVID
for the same SPIFFE ID, binding key `K`. The following decoded payload
omits the optional `iss`; the IdP uses the configured trust anchors
for `workloads.example`. Its protected header uses `typ=wit+jwt`,
`alg=ES256`, and a `kid` selecting a key in that trusted bundle.

~~~ json
{
  "sub": "spiffe://workloads.example/agents/support",
  "iat": 1789128000,
  "exp": 1789131600,
  "cnf": {
    "jwk": {
      "kty": "EC",
      "crv": "P-256",
      "alg": "ES256",
      "x": "VcKVNBZ4IaBAYW3jxM4w3TJFVA7myeUGQyGt-g_yvpQ",
      "y": "f-E-hYE3TAWKwhVv9pej9NABs9SX9XsNO80x57jFTyU"
    }
  }
}
~~~

The harness sends this request over server-authenticated TLS. The
Client Attestation PoP JWT has `aud=https://idp.example/tenant/acme`,
a fresh `iat` and unique `jti`, and the IdP's challenge if supplied.
It uses `typ=oauth-client-attestation-pop+jwt`. Both that proof and
the DPoP proof are signed with `K` using `ES256`.

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
OAuth-Client-Attestation: eyJ...wit-svid...
OAuth-Client-Attestation-PoP: eyJ...attestation-pop...
DPoP: eyJ...proof-K...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Atoken-exchange
&client_id=spiffe%3A%2F%2Fworkloads.example%2Fagents%2Fsupport
&requested_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Awag

&subject_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Ajwt
&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fas.app.example
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.app.example
&scope=tickets.read
~~~

The same WIT-SVID appears in the header and `subject_token`. The IdP
validates it and both proofs, resolves `agent-42`, checks assignments,
and returns WAG with `sub=agent-42` and `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)`. No IdP access
token is acquired. The extra JWK `alg` member does not change the
RFC 7638 thumbprint. The harness redeems WAG and calls the API as
shown above. For user-delegated access, it instead obtains or reuses
an IdP actor token under {{bootstrap}} and {{delegated-exchange}}.

### Platform-Issued JWT Variant {#platform-jwt-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

Use this model when the IdP imports an agent from a cloud or agent
platform. The following binding uses a shared platform subject plus
an agent identifier and tenant restriction. Its exact selectors are
`iss=https://agents.cloud.example/tenant/acme`,
`sub=agent-service`, `platform_agent=support-agent-7`, and
`tenant=acme`. Together they identify Registered Agent `agent-42`;
no OAuth client is needed for this self-acting exchange. The issuer
is configured as a dedicated workload credential issuer. The
platform-specific claims are illustrative, not new claim registrations.
Decoded platform JWT:

~~~ json
{
  "iss": "https://agents.cloud.example/tenant/acme",
  "sub": "agent-service",
  "platform_agent": "support-agent-7",
  "tenant": "acme",
  "aud": "https://idp.example/tenant/acme",
  "iat": 1789128000,
  "exp": 1789128600,
  "jti": "plat-4d1e"
}
~~~

The harness generates `K` and presents the JWT only as subject
evidence, with a DPoP proof containing the IdP's nonce:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...proof-K...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Atoken-exchange
&requested_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Awag
&subject_token=eyJ...platform-jwt...
&subject_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Ajwt
&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fas.app.example
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.app.example
&scope=tickets.read
~~~

The IdP validates the signature with the configured issuer's keys,
matches every selector, and checks `agent-42`'s assignments. It issues
WAG directly with `sub=agent-42` and `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)`. The harness
redeems WAG at the RAS and calls the API as above. Subsequent WAG
requests can reuse the platform JWT within its permitted age and
lifetime with fresh proofs from `K` under {{platform-jwt-input}}.
The platform never sees `K`; DPoP binds the grant but does not prove
an independently registered OAuth client identity.

For a platform that already names the individual agent in `sub`,
the binding can instead use only its issuer and that exact `sub`.
Multiple approved bindings can resolve to the same Registered Agent
without forcing platforms to share an OAuth client namespace.

### Shared Client in a Managed Platform {#platform-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

Use this model when a hosting platform runs separately governed
agents through one OAuth client. The IdP approves the platform
attester `https://attester.example/tenant/acme` for shared client
`https://platform.example/oauth-client`, mapping its
`agent_id=support-agent-7` to Registered Agent `agent-42`.

The platform attester supplies the Client Attestation. The harness
exchanges it directly for WAG, without an intermediate IdP access token.

1. The control plane launches `support-agent-7`. Its harness generates
   `K`. The attester verifies the launch assignment, runtime
   isolation, and key possession, then issues an attestation with
   `sub` equal to the shared client, `agent_id=support-agent-7`,
   `client_instance_id=i-bc6701a8d32549ef80e143fd267b95ca`, and `cnf.jwk` containing the public
   key. This deployment opts into execution-level instance tracking.
   The harness cannot select another agent merely by naming it.
2. The harness follows {{direct-wag}}, sending the shared `client_id`
   and the same attestation in `OAuth-Client-Attestation` and
   `subject_token`, with a DPoP proof from `K`. The IdP resolves
   `(iss, sub, agent_id)` to `agent-42`, validates instance context,
   and authorizes the requested access using the agent's assignments.
3. The IdP returns WAG with `sub=agent-42`, no `act`, validated
   instance context, and `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)`. The harness redeems it
   and calls the API as described in {{app-consumption}}.

A second runtime for this agent gets a different instance identifier
and key, but the same `agent-42` principal. A different agent behind
the shared client has its own binding and permissions. The IdP
does not infer equivalent authority from the common client identity.

## Agent Acting on Behalf of a User {#delegated-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

The user is the ID-JAG subject and the Registered Agent its actor;
the flow ends with a sender-constrained access token that carries
both.

### Harness on a Managed Device {#device-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

Use this model when an enterprise governs a desktop agent as a
Registered Agent with its own client identity. The example binds
`client_id=https://desktop.example/agents/dev-17` to `agent-17`.
The IdP trusts `https://devices.example/attester` to attest this client.
The managed device, the agent, and the running harness are different
entities; device enrollment does not itself authorize user delegation.

~~~

1. The harness generates `K` and starts sign-in in an external
   browser using an authorization code flow with PKCE under
   {{RFC8252}}. The enterprise records user or administrator approval
   for this agent to read tickets for that user. Sign-in alone is
   not delegation approval.
2. After the browser returns the code, the enterprise attester
   validates device evidence, harness and agent assignment, and key
   possession. This deployment opts into installation-level instance
   identification: the Client Attestation has the agent's client
   identifier as `sub`, `client_instance_id=i-64b89d23c05a4e1f9a76bd2381d0e547`, and
   `cnf.jwk` containing `K`'s public key, without `agent_id`. The
   harness redeems the code with PKCE and fresh ATTEST authentication
   to obtain its user ID Token. Device evidence and issuance APIs
   remain deployment-specific under {{ATTEST}}.
3. The harness then obtains its IdP access token under {{bootstrap}},
   identifying `agent-17`, the client, optional installation context,
   and `JKT(K)`, or reuses an eligible token. Acquisition follows the
   interactive wait so the short token lifetime is available for
   exchange. If credentials expire before exchange, the harness
   renews the required evidence and token; it does not bypass checks.
4. The harness follows {{delegated-exchange}}, sending the user
   ID Token as `subject_token` and the IdP access token as
   `actor_token`, with fresh ATTEST authentication. The IdP validates
   both identities and the delegation, then issues ID-JAG with
   `sub=user-17`, `act={iss: IdP, sub: agent-17, sub_profile: ai_agent}`,
   and the downstream client identifier `dev-agent-at-app`.
5. The harness redeems ID-JAG and accesses the API as described in
   {{app-consumption}}, authenticating as `dev-agent-at-app` with
   the separate RAS credential described in {{ras-auth}}. The device
   attester and device record do not become actors.

The redemption request appears in {{ras-auth}} and the response has
the shape shown above, with `sub=user-17` and `act.sub=agent-17` in
the resulting access token.

If the enterprise only needs existing client-based delegation, the
harness can use the ID-JAG/EMA path in {{deployment}} without the
agent bootstrap and actor token. A desktop harness shared by several
separately governed agents instead uses the shared-client binding
illustrated in {{platform-flow}}. Device hosting does not select
the identity model automatically.

### Shared Client Variant
{:numbered="false"}

For user-delegated work in the shared-client platform deployment of
{{platform-flow}}, the harness obtains or reuses an IdP access token
under {{bootstrap}}, then follows {{delegated-exchange}} with an
accepted user credential and that actor token. After checking
delegation approval, the IdP issues ID-JAG with the user as `sub` and
`agent-42` as `act`. Its downstream `client_id` is `platform-at-app`;
redemption uses the platform signing service in {{ras-auth}}. The
hosting platform is client context, not an additional actor.

### Imported Platform Agent Acting for a User {#platform-delegated-flow}
{:numbered="false"}

The binding in {{platform-jwt-flow}} also permits the IdP-assigned OAuth client
`agent-harness-23` to act as `agent-42`. The harness separately
provisions a client credential, here `private_key_jwt` using key `C`
registered with the IdP. The platform JWT does not authenticate that
client. A platform unable to supply a client credential can use the
self-acting path but cannot use this delegated path by itself.

1. The harness obtains the platform JWT above and generates or retains
   `K`. It authenticates `agent-harness-23` with a client assertion
   signed by `C` and exchanges the platform JWT for an IdP access
   token under {{platform-acquisition}}. The IdP verifies both the
   agent binding and that this client is permitted to use it.
2. The returned token has `sub=agent-42`, `client_id=agent-harness-23`,
   the IdP issuer as `aud`, and `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)`. It records the platform
   input and binding. Its lifetime is at most 300 seconds.
3. The harness obtains a user credential for `user-17`, issued to
   `agent-harness-23`, and an applicable user or administrator approval
   for this agent, client, resource, and scope. It requests ID-JAG
   with the user credential as subject and the IdP token as actor,
   authenticating the same client and proving `K` again. No platform
   JWT is included in this request.
4. The IdP checks the token, current platform binding, permitted client,
   user credential, and approval. It issues ID-JAG with `sub=user-17`,
   `act.sub=agent-42`, and the configured downstream
   `client_id=platform-at-app`. The harness redeems it using that
   client's separate downstream credential and proof from `K`, as
   described in {{ras-auth}}, then uses the application token at the API.

The acquisition request is:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...proof-K...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Atoken-exchange
&client_id=agent-harness-23
&client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJ...idp-client-assertion-C...
&requested_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Aaccess_token

&subject_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Ajwt
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example%2Ftenant%2Facme
~~~

The client assertion has `iss` and `sub` equal to `agent-harness-23`,
an audience accepted by the IdP for client authentication, short
expiration, and a unique `jti`. It is signed by `C`, independently
of the platform JWT and the DPoP key `K`. The DPoP proof includes
an IdP nonce. The response is:

~~~ json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...platform-agent-access-token...",
  "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token",
  "token_type": "DPoP",
  "expires_in": 300
}
~~~

Using that token, the delegated request is:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: idp.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...fresh-proof-K...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Atoken-exchange
&client_id=agent-harness-23
&client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJ...fresh-idp-client-assertion-C...
&requested_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Aid-jag
&subject_token=eyJ...user-id-token-for-agent-harness-23...
&subject_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Aid_token
&actor_token=eyJ...platform-agent-access-token...
&actor_token_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Atoken-type%3Aaccess_token
&audience=https%3A%2F%2Fas.app.example
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.app.example
&scope=tickets.read
~~~

The IdP binds the user's credential to the authenticated client,
and the actor token to that same client and `K`. The platform JWT's
`sub` remains `agent-service`; the OAuth client is `agent-harness-23`;
the governed actor is `agent-42`. None of these identifiers substitutes
for the other two. Renewal follows {{delegated-lifecycle}}.

## Client Authentication at the RAS {#ras-auth}
{:numbered="false"}

These examples separate the DPoP key `K` from a registered client
signing key `C`. Before delegated access, the RAS has registered
`C`'s public key for the following client; the IdP knows the client-ID
mapping. This is client credential provisioning, independent of the
agent record and of trust in the IdP as grant issuer.

| Deployment | Downstream client | Custody of client signing key C |
|---|---|---|
| Managed device | `dev-agent-at-app` | Protected storage for this managed installation; its public key is enrolled at the RAS |
| Managed platform | `platform-at-app` | Platform signing service; an authorized harness obtains a short-lived assertion without receiving the private key |

At redemption, the harness supplies a fresh `private_key_jwt`
assertion signed with `C`. Its `iss` and `sub` equal the downstream
client identifier, its `aud` is the RAS issuer, and it has a short
expiration and unique `jti`, validated under {{RFC7523}}. A separate
DPoP proof from `K` proves possession of the grant's binding key.
Neither credential substitutes for the other. The self-acting WAG
example redeems the bound grant with a DPoP proof and no client
authentication, as {{consumption}} permits for WAG.

Illustrative desktop redemption; the client assertion and ID-JAG
are different JWTs with different purposes and signing authorities:

~~~ http
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: as.app.example
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
DPoP: eyJ...grant-key-proof...

grant_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Agrant-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&assertion=eyJ...idp-id-jag...
&resource=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.app.example
&client_id=dev-agent-at-app
&client_assertion_type=urn%3Aietf%3Aparams%3Aoauth%3Aclient-assertion-type%3Ajwt-bearer
&client_assertion=eyJ...client-key-assertion...
~~~

The RAS uses its client registration to validate the client assertion
and its IdP trust to validate ID-JAG. It does not need to accept the
enterprise or platform attester as an agent-identity authority.
If a deployment instead authenticates the client with ATTEST at the
RAS, it needs a separate, explicit RAS attester trust configuration;
trust in the IdP's grant does not create that relationship.

## Downstream Application Processing {#app-consumption}
{:numbered="false"}

Both use cases finish at the same application trust boundary:

1. The harness presents the IdP-issued grant to the RAS using the
   selected grant's redemption procedure and the client authentication
   in {{ras-auth}}, including ID-JAG's downstream client binding.
   Its DPoP proof uses the key named by the grant's `cnf.jkt`.
2. The RAS validates the trusted IdP signature, issuer, audience,
   lifetime, replay state, target resource, scopes, and key proof.
   It resolves the subject and any actor, applies local assignments,
   and issues an API access token. In these examples it retains
   the IdP's principal identifiers and uses a JWT access token.
3. The API receives only its access token and a fresh DPoP proof,
   including the access-token hash under {{RFC9449}}. It validates
   the token and proof, then evaluates resource policy for the agent
   or the user and agent actor. It does not consume the upstream
   SVID, device evidence, Client Attestation, WAG, or ID-JAG.

| Example | Application access-token identity | Key binding |
|---|---|---|
| SPIFFE workload, self-acting | `sub=agent-42`, no `act` | `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)` |
| Imported platform agent, self-acting | `sub=agent-42`, no `act` | `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)` |
| Imported platform agent, delegated | User `sub`, `act.sub=agent-42` | `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)` |
| Managed device, delegated | `sub=user-17`, `act.sub=agent-17` | `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)` |
| Managed platform, self-acting | `sub=agent-42`, no `act` | `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)` |
| Managed platform, delegated variant | User `sub`, `act.sub=agent-42` | `cnf.jkt=JKT(K)` |

For delegated tokens, the actor also retains its IdP `iss` and
`sub_profile=ai_agent` under Actor Profile. The RAS is the access-token
issuer and the API is its audience. Groups and owner relationships
can come from provisioned records or approved claims; user groups
do not supply an agent actor's memberships. Optional instance context
supports audit and risk without changing those principal identities.

## One Agent Record for Self-Acting and Delegated Access {#provisioning-example}
{:numbered="false"}

The RAS has an authenticated SCIM provisioning relationship with
IdP issuer `https://idp.example/tenant/acme`. The IdP provisions the
following Agent resource using {{SCIM-AGENT}}. The RAS assigns `id`;
the IdP supplies `externalId`. The issuer association is kept with
the provisioning relationship, not encoded in a new SCIM attribute.

~~~ json
{
  "schemas": ["urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Agent"],
  "id": "ra-42",
  "externalId": "agent-42",
  "agentUserName": "support-agent",
  "displayName": "Support Agent",
  "active": true
}
~~~

The application's directory records `ra-42` as a member of group
`support-eng`; its local policy grants that group `tickets.read`.
This is a provisioned group relationship, not a claim inferred from
the agent name or a new group schema. Both grant paths resolve the
same record under {{agent-correlation}}:

| Validated grant | Agent lookup | Record and policy input |
|---|---|---|
| WAG: `iss=https://idp.example/tenant/acme`, `sub=agent-42` | `(iss, sub)` | `ra-42`, member of `support-eng` |
| ID-JAG: `sub=user-17`, `act.iss=https://idp.example/tenant/acme`, `act.sub=agent-42` | `(act.iss, act.sub)` | The same `ra-42` and membership |

For delegated access, the application also evaluates `user-17`'s
permissions and the authorized delegation. The agent's group does
not add that user to the group. An equal `agent-42` from another
issuer does not match this record. Setting `active=false` blocks new
issuance once applied by the relevant server; already-issued tokens
follow the deployment's expiration and revocation behavior.

# Interoperability Test Cases
{:numbered="false"}

This appendix is informative; the normative requirements are in the
body. Independent platform, client, IdP, and RAS implementations can
exercise:

| Case | Expected result |
|---|---|
| Direct WAG with ATTEST agent as client; approved binding and proof, instance extension disabled | WAG for the Registered Agent, without acquisition or stable instance context |
| Direct WAG with shared-client ATTEST; approved `(iss, sub, agent_id)` and key proof | WAG subject is the Registered Agent, not the shared client |
| Shared client omits `agent_id` | Reject; no fallback to client-only binding |
| Agent with its own client identity supplies `agent_id` | Reject; no switch to the shared-client model |
| Missing, ambiguous, or disabled binding | Reject issuance |
| Grant with tenant B `iss` signed by tenant A's key, including colliding `kid` | Reject; key lookup is scoped to exact issuer |
| Valid grant for one RAS also lists another audience | Reject; exactly one RAS issuer is allowed |
| Replayed grant during allowed expiration skew | Reject; consumed identifiers remain recorded through `exp` plus skew |
| Platform JWT with no valid IdP-provided DPoP nonce | `use_dpop_nonce`; no grant issued |
| Platform JWT outside the configured credential class or older than the bounded age | Reject input |
| Valid client and user credentials, with absent, revoked, or expired approval | Same non-enumerating `actor_unauthorized` response |
| Instance context names an unconfigured authority | Reject context; no required-context fallback |
| Authenticated disabled-agent status reaches the RAS | Block subsequent issuance and refresh; revoke or deactivate affected tokens as supported |
| Direct WAG with platform JWT; approved issuer and exact selectors, nonce and DPoP proof; no client authentication required by the binding | WAG for the bound agent without acquisition or `client_id` |
| Platform-issued JWT with an unapproved issuer, wrong audience, or expired | Reject subject evidence with `invalid_grant` |
| Platform JWT with an unbound subject, missing additional selector, or wrong exact claim value | `invalid_grant`; no prefix, wildcard, or partial match |
| Shared platform subject plus exact agent and tenant claims matches one approved binding | Resolve that Registered Agent independently of OAuth `client_id` |
| Platform JWT presented as `client_assertion` without independent client authentication | Does not authenticate the OAuth client |
| Platform acquisition with a valid JWT but no separate client authentication, or an unauthorized client | Reject; workload evidence alone cannot obtain the actor credential |
| Platform acquisition requests an audience, scope, or actor | `invalid_request` |
| Platform-origin actor token used with another authenticated client or DPoP key | `invalid_grant` |
| Platform-origin actor token used after its recorded binding is disabled | Reject even though the token is unexpired |
| Platform-origin actor token, same permitted client and key, current binding, valid user and approval; no platform JWT resent | Issue ID-JAG |
| Platform JWT with missing or mistyped `iat`, invalid time ordering, excessive age or lifetime, or future `iat` beyond clock skew | `invalid_grant` |
| Cached platform JWT reused with the same binding and key, all other checks valid | Accept with fresh DPoP proof |
| Previously used platform JWT presented with another key, including a different signature over the same signing input | `invalid_grant`; no new key association |
| X.509-SVID client with approved exact ID and DPoP proof | IdP access token without stable instance context |
| Direct WAG with WIT-SVID; approved exact ID, attestation PoP, matching DPoP key; no `iss` | WAG for the configured agent without acquisition |
| WIT-SVID with missing attestation PoP, mismatched key or proof algorithm, or expired credential | Reject authentication or proof |
| WIT-SVID with unapproved trust domain or mismatched `client_id` | Reject; `iss` cannot select another trust anchor |
| Renewed X.509-SVID, same binding and DPoP key | Existing eligible token remains usable |
| Renewed WIT-SVID, same binding and unchanged `cnf.jwk` | Existing eligible token remains usable |
| Renewed WIT-SVID with a new `cnf.jwk` | Reject exchange with the old token; new IdP access token required |
| Direct WAG using a renewed WIT-SVID and proofs from its new key | WAG bound to the new key; no IdP access token required |
| Unexpired token from this document's acquisition; same client, agent, input method, and key | Reused without reacquisition |
| Access token from any other issuance, even with a matching audience | Not eligible as an IdP access-token input; use direct WAG or acquire an eligible token |
| Direct ATTEST or WIT-SVID subject differs from the authentication JWT, even for the same identity | `invalid_grant` |
| Direct JWT input contains `act` | `invalid_grant`; no conversion from delegation to self-acting access |
| X.509-SVID request omits `subject_token` | `invalid_request`; use the access-token adapter |
| Direct external credential supplied as ID-JAG `actor_token` | Reject; this delegated path requires the IdP-issued actor token |
| Same registered agent through direct WAG and the access-token adapter | Same WAG `sub` and issuer namespace |
| Same agent in a second execution | Same agent subject; distinct context if execution tracking is configured |
| Unrelated client, agent, instance, or key at exchange | Reject inconsistent evidence |
| Agent acting for itself | WAG subject is the agent; no `act` |
| Agent acting for a user | User subject; Registered Agent `act` |
| Canonical agent identifier in the IdP access token | Same value in WAG `sub` and ID-JAG `act.sub`; no recipient-specific substitution |
| Valid user and agent credentials without delegation | `actor_unauthorized` |
| Unsupported requested output | `invalid_request`; no fallback |
| Optional downstream instance context | Same principal and binding semantics |
| Configured instance extension, missing or mismatched evidence | Reject; no fallback to key-only processing |
| Grant redemption with missing or mismatched proof | Reject under the bound-grant rules |
| Redemption without `resource`, or with `resource` not matching the grant | `invalid_target` |
| Replayed grant with a valid DPoP proof | `invalid_grant`; grants are single use |
| WAG with a previously unseen `sub` under an allowlisted `iss` | Access token issued; record-dependent authorization withheld until correlated |
| ID-JAG redemption with DPoP but no required client authentication | Reject; DPoP is not the registered client credential |
| WAG subject and ID-JAG actor name the same IdP agent | Resolve the same provisioned record |
| Same bare agent identifier from another issuer | No match to the original issuer's record |

Only cases for the implemented input and output are applicable.
Existing client-based deployments are compatibility context, not an additional

# Coordination with Related Work {#coordination}
{:numbered="false"}

*RFC EDITOR: Remove this section before publication.*

## WAG Gaps Filled by This Document {#wag-gaps}
{:numbered="false"}

WAG-00 names IdP issuance through token exchange as an open
composition and leaves several properties of the grant undefined.
This document fills them in {{wag-profile}}, {{consumption}}, and
{{iana}} so that implementations can proceed. Each item below is a
property of every Workload Authorization Grant, however obtained,
and is offered to WAG as upstream text; once WAG defines an item,
this document will reference WAG and remove its own definition.

Token type for token exchange:
: Defined here as `urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:wag`, registered
  in {{iana}}. Needed because {{RFC8693}} identifies the requested
  and issued token by a type URI; without one an IdP cannot issue a
  WAG through exchange and a client cannot ask for one. Belongs in
  WAG because every party that obtains a WAG by exchange needs the
  same value, and WAG Sections 5 and 11 already contemplate
  exchange-based issuance.

Explicit JWT type:
: Defined here as `typ=oauth-wag+jwt`, with the media type
  registered in {{iana}}. Needed because a RAS token endpoint that
  accepts several JWT grants must distinguish a WAG from an ID-JAG,
  an access token, or a client assertion; {{RFC8725}} requires
  explicit typing for that purpose. Belongs in WAG because the type
  identifies the format, not the issuer; ID-JAG registers its own.

Sender-constrained grant:
: Defined here as `cnf.jkt` in the grant, a DPoP proof at
  redemption, a key match, and `invalid_grant` on mismatch. Needed
  because WAG-00 Section 5.1 leaves the grant a bearer assertion, so
  a stolen grant is redeemable by anyone within its lifetime, while
  this document keeps the agent binding key-bound end to end.
  Belongs in WAG because its own Section 5.1 lists sender constraint
  as the open option, the check runs at the RAS regardless of
  issuer, and mirroring ID-JAG's bound-grant procedure lets a RAS
  implement one procedure for both grants.

`scope` and `resource` claims:
: Defined here as REQUIRED claims using ID-JAG's definitions. Needed
  because the grant must carry the authorized downstream access;
  WAG-00 carries `resource` only as a redemption parameter and has
  no `scope` claim, so a RAS cannot check the request against the
  grant. Belongs in WAG because claim definitions are part of the
  format, and parity with ID-JAG simplifies RAS processing.

Redemption error responses:
: Defined here as `invalid_grant` for validation and proof
  failures, `invalid_target` for a `resource` mismatch, and
  `invalid_scope` for scopes beyond the grant. Needed because
  WAG-00 defines no error responses, so clients cannot implement
  interoperable recovery. Belongs in WAG because the responses are
  RAS behavior common to every WAG.

Single-use grants:
: Defined here as the RAS tracking `(iss, jti)` for at least the
  grant lifetime and rejecting replay. Needed because {{RFC7523}}
  leaves replay detection optional, and a replayed grant mints
  additional access tokens even when key-bound. Belongs in WAG
  because it is redemption behavior independent of the issuer.

No actor claim:
: Defined here as a WAG MUST NOT contain `act`. Needed because a
  WAG represents a self-acting agent, and an actor claim would make
  it indistinguishable from a delegated grant at the RAS. Belongs in
  WAG because it is a statement about the format.

Issuer placement:
: Defined here as the IdP taking WAG's per-tenancy issuer role,
  with key resolution by `iss` through the RAS allowlist and `sub`
  equal to the Registered Agent identifier. Needed because WAG-00
  Sections 5 and 11 name the enterprise IdP as an issuer but leave
  the composition open. WAG needs only one paragraph acknowledging
  the IdP placement and pointing to this document; the mechanics
  remain here because they depend on the IdP having resolved a
  governed agent.

Items that need WAG's agreement rather than new text: `aud`
carrying the issuer identifier alone, which WAG already accepts;
the Agent Properties claim names once WAG's Section 8 settles, and
whether `groups`, `roles`, and `name` reference their registered
{{RFC9068}} and OpenID Connect definitions; and WAG's Informational
status against this document's normative reference. Advertising
WAG output through `identity_chaining_requested_token_types_supported`
also needs confirmation with identity chaining.


## Other Coordination Items
{:numbered="false"}

Pairwise agent identifiers need an explicit Actor Profile extension.
This document currently preserves the actor token's `sub`; it does
not override Actor Profile's JWT access-token actor construction.

Actor Profile's generic JWT-grant audience guidance uses a token
endpoint, while ID-JAG uses the RAS issuer. This document selects
ID-JAG's audience and needs grant-profile precedence clarified in
Actor Profile. ID-JAG and WAG both redeem with
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`, while ID-JAG's
bound-grant example and {{JWT-DPOP}} use
`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-dpop` for DPoP-bound JWTs. This
document follows the normative text of ID-JAG and WAG, sending a DPoP
proof with the jwt-bearer grant, and will follow ID-JAG if it adopts
the jwt-dpop grant type. This document does not register a competing
redemption mechanism.

SPIFFE OAuth's WIT-SVID binding and its authentication-method metadata
need alignment with the evolving ATTEST proof modes. This document
selects `spiffe_wit` with the separate Client Attestation PoP JWT
specified by SPIFFE OAuth, plus DPoP bound to the same key. It does
not infer combined-mode support from that method name. General WIT
inputs, including direct Actor Profile input, need separate agreement
on identity mapping and trust-domain validation when `iss` is absent.

# Document History
{:numbered="false"}

*RFC EDITOR: Remove this section before publication.*

* Intended, with draft-mcguinness-oauth-client-instance-identification,
  to replace draft-mcguinness-oauth-ai-agent-instance.
* Focused the standards-track profile on platform-to-IdP agent
  identity binding, access-token acquisition, and grant issuance.
* Defined ATTEST and SPIFFE X.509-SVID inputs, optional instance
  identification, eligible-token reuse, and Actor Profile delegation.
* Added WIT-SVID authentication with trust-domain identity resolution,
  attestation proof, DPoP key binding, and credential renewal rules.
* Used `client_id` as agent identity when the agent is the client;
  required `agent_id` only for agents represented by a shared client.
* Completed deployment examples with downstream client authentication,
  credential timing, and issuer-qualified provisioning correlation.
* Defined IdP issuance of WAG: token type, JWT type, issuer model,
  audience, key binding, claims, Agent Properties, redemption, and
  errors; registered the token type and media type.
* Moved existing client flows and deployment choices to informative
  guidance and inherited downstream grant processing.
* Consolidated cross-input rules into one contract in the inputs
  section and recorded the input method with issued tokens.
* Limited access-token reuse to tokens issued under this document's
  acquisition, selected `use_fresh_attestation` for attestations
  outside configured age limits, and split the SVID renewal
  interoperability case.
* Required sender-constrained downstream access tokens, kept
  jwt-bearer redemption with a DPoP proof, and added shared-client
  and agent-identifier privacy considerations.
* Cited identity-chaining metadata for ID-JAG and WAG output.
* Led the Introduction with the three identity dimensions and both
  acting relationships, and stated why the IdP-issued access token
  exists.
* Defined Source Tenant, Target Tenant, and Agent Status;
  consolidated evidence-combination rules; explained the shared-client
  model against CIMD per-agent identifiers.
* Reorganized the end-to-end examples around the agent acting for
  itself and on behalf of a user, adding WAG redemption at the RAS.
* Decoupled artifact lifetimes, replaced the fixed attestation
  lifetime with configured age limits, and made the exchange DPoP
  proof's dual role explicit with server nonces recommended.
* Required single-use grants and `resource` at every redemption,
  clarified the self-issued token's audience and the RAS authorization
  paths for WAG, and tied Agent Properties to registered claim
  definitions.
* Stated the shared-client delegation-approval requirement, explained
  the RAR exclusion, and completed the media type registration
  template.
* Listed the WAG gaps this document fills, with the reason each is
  needed and why it belongs in WAG.
* Added platform registry import, explicit JWT timestamp checks,
  and cached-token reuse with the first proven key; preserved canonical
  actor identifiers pending a coordinated pairwise-identifier profile.
* Made direct platform JWT, Client Attestation, and WIT-SVID exchange
  the preferred WAG path; retained IdP access-token acquisition for
  X.509-SVID and canonical actor input for delegated ID-JAG.
* Isolated tenant signing keys, bounded clock skew, specified replay
  retention and downstream status handling, moved adapter eligibility
  before exchange, and clarified approval and delegated renewal rules.
* Moved platform JWTs to token-exchange subject evidence, with exact
  issuer-qualified claim mappings independent of OAuth client identity.
  Kept direct WAG without mandatory client authentication and required
  separate standard client authentication for platform actor-token
  acquisition and delegated exchange.
